Welcome to the planning repo for the Chicago R Unconf! We will use this repository to start brainstorming different project ideas. Please share any and all ideas that come to mind -- no idea is too big, too small, too silly, or too hard. We can continue to discuss and refine throughout the week to learn how to best spend our time together.

Stuck brainstorming? Here are some questions to spur your creativity:

- What is a package that you struggled to learn to use? Could you write a new vignette or example to help other beginners?
- What is your biggest pet peeve as a data analyst or R user? Can you imagine a tool that could help solve that problem? (Whether or not you think you know how to build it!)
- What's your favorite project / problem you've ever faced? Have you tried to share this with others? How might you be able to?

Beyond working on new projects and packages, there will also be plenty opportunities to work with some of our mentors on their existing packages. Please do check out their issues (tagged with `Chicago R Unconference`, `chirunconf`, etc.) and consider getting involved!

When making contributions to existing repos, here are a few things to consider:

- Pay attention to the package's current code style (e.g. does it use = or <-) and try your best to emulate!
- Check out what packages are currently dependencies in the package's DESCRIPTION file. It's courteous not to submit code which requires additional dependencies without checking with the maintainer first 
- When possible, please include unit tests with your PR to help maintainers get confidence in your submission. This may also help them to accept your contribution more quickly!

Happy brainstorming! We look forward to seeing you all next week!
